This directory contains bootloaders for FAT12 file system. 
They load KERNEL.MNT file from floppy root directory to address 0x1000:0
then pass control to 0x1000:0.

loader-realmode.asm is bootloader used in MenuetOS.
loader-protected.asm is modified version with added switch to protected mode.
