Experiment with kernel function addresses
For more detailes see post:
http://dev64.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/function-addresses-in-kernel/

The kernel should be loaded by Boot Loader to 0x1000:0.
This expreriment demonstrates the 32bit addresses of functions in kernel
built from elf32 object files.

After start the kernel prints function addresses and stops.
You can see the correspondence of addresses to addresses in kernel.map 
file produced by linker.

All code is working in Real Mode yet.

The kernel entry point is file: kernel/entry/x86_16/start.asm
start.asm depends on several library functions placed to
klib/x86_16 directory.

The descriptions and calling convesions for klib functions are
placed to include/asm/klib.inc

To build:

cd build
make

Done.

make install will copy kernel to MSDOS floppy if floppy is 
present in /dev/fd0
