Experiment with protected mode console functions

The kernel starts in real mode, gets avalable memory map,
enters protected mode, prints some test messages and memory map to
console in protected mode. Just to show kernel console functions.

For more detailes see post:

The kernel entry point is file: kernel/entry/x86_16/start.asm
start.asm depends on several library functions placed to
klib/x86_16 directory and klib/x86_32


To build:

cd build
make

Done.

make install will copy kernel to MSDOS floppy if floppy is 
present in /dev/fd0
