This is first experiment placed in GitHub.

These are some sources of OS Kernel in asm.
OS Kernel is loaded by Boot Loader to address 0x1000:0

Then memory detection routine is called and the results 
are printed to screen using BIOS function.

All code is working in Real Mode yet.

The kernel entry point is file: kernel/entry/x86_16/start.asm
start.asm depends on several library functions placed to
klib/x86_16 directory.

The descriptions and calling convesions for klib functions are
placed to include/asm/klib.inc


To build:

cd build
make

Done.

make install will copy kernel to MSDOS floppy if floppy is 
present in /dev/fd0
