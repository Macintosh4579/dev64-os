Experiment with placing linear kernel address space to upper 4M page.
For detailes see:
http://dev64.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/virtual-address-space-in-kernel/


The kernel entry point is file: kernel/entry/x86_16/start.asm
start.asm depends on several library functions.

The funtion which turns on paging placed withing paging.asm file.


To build:

cd build
make

Done.

make install will copy kernel to MSDOS floppy if floppy is 
present in /dev/fd0
