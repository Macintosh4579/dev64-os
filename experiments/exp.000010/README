This is experiment with assembler local callback functions
(a-la lambda see console.printInSpecifiedPosition in start.asm
For more information:

The kernel entry point is file: kernel/entry/x86_16/start.asm
start.asm depends on several library functions placed to
klib/x86_16 directory.


To build:

cd build
make

Done.

make install will copy kernel to MSDOS floppy if floppy is 
present in /dev/fd0
