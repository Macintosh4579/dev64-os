This directory contain an experiment with physical memory (physical pages)
management structures initialization.

Function populate_page_list() takes the array with available 
memory regions received from BIOS and array of reserved 
memory regions (provided by OS developer) and calculates
resulted memory pages available for physical memory management
subsystem.

The function add_memory_block() is called for each memory
region. The OS developer should implement custom add_memory_block()
function which will initialize memory structures used by
physical pages management subsystem.

I have used CodeBlocks and MiniGW to compile and test this
code. Any version of gcc is suitable.
