Experiment with timer setting and system uptime calculation.
Added initialization of Programmable Interval Timer (PIT),
Updated handling of IRQ0 interrupts and added printing of system
uptime in the main loop.

For more detailes see post:

The kernel entry point is file: kernel/entry/x86_16/start.asm
start.asm depends on several library functions placed to
klib/x86_16 directory.


To build:

cd build
make

Done.

make install will copy kernel to MSDOS floppy if floppy is 
present in /dev/fd0
