Experiment with keyboard interrupts handling. 
For more detailes see post:
http://dev64.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/keyboard-interrupts-handler-in-kernel/


The kernel entry point is file: kernel/entry/x86_16/start.asm
start.asm depends on several library functions placed to
klib/x86_16 directory.


To build:

cd build
make

Done.

make install will copy kernel to MSDOS floppy if floppy is 
present in /dev/fd0
